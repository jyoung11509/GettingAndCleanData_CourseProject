This program takes the training and test data, merges it, and extracts the mean and standard deviation information from each factor.

It assumes that you are in the UCI HAR DATASET directory when running.

The tidy data set will be created in "merged_data.txt".

The long form of the tidy data set was chosen so as to make each factor clear.
